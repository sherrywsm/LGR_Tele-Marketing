Logistic regression on a bank's telephone marketing data to predict if a client will subscribe to a term deposit 

A Portuguese bank conducted seventeen telephone marketing campaigns between May 2008 and November 2010. The bank recorded client contact information for each telephone call. The bank wants its clients to invest in term deposits. A term deposit is an investment such as a certificate of deposit. The interest rate and duration of the deposit are set in advance. A term deposit is distinct from a demand deposit. The bank is interest in identifying factors that affect client responses to new term deposit offerings, which are the focus of the marketing campaigns. 

Dataset: Client characteristics include demographic factors: age, job type, marital status, and education. The clientâ€™s previous use of banking services is also noted. Current contact information shows the date of the telephone call and the duration of the call. There is also information about the call immediately preceding the current call, as well as summary information about all calls with the client.

The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) to a term deposit (variable y).
